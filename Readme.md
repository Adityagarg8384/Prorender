## Team Details

**Team Name:** Hexagon6

**Team Leader:** [@Piyush7982](https://github.com/Piyush7982)

**Project Title:** Pro-care

**Project Description:** The proposed solution involves the development of an AI-powered healthcare system that integrates three AI models to address the needs of chronic disease prediction, general disease diagnosis, and personalized medicine recommendation.

Chronic Disease Prediction Model -This AI model is trained on extensive patient data, including lifestyle factors, medical history, and genetic information. It can predict the likelihood of chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension.’

General Disease Prediction Model- The model focuses on diagnosing a wide range of diseases based on symptoms. Using machine learning algorithms, it analyzes patient inputs such as symptoms to accurately diagnose conditions.

Medicine Recommendation Model-:Once a diagnosis is made, this model provides personalized medicine recommendations tailored to the patient’s specific condition, medical history, and potential drug interactions. It leverages a vast database of pharmaceutical information and clinical guidelines to suggest the most effective and safe treatment options.
