## Tasks Accomplished

- [x] **Task 1:** AI-Powered Diagnostics: Implement machine learning models that analyze patient data (e.g., medical history, lab results, imaging data) to assist in diagnosing conditions and recommending treatment options. The models should be able to identify patterns and anomalies that may indicate various health conditions.
- [x] **Task 2:** Predictive Analytics for Patient Health: Develop predictive models that analyze historical patient data to forecast potential health risks and suggest preventive measures. For example, predicting the likelihood of developing chronic conditions based on lifestyle and genetic factors.
- [x] **Task 3:** Personalized Treatment Recommendations: Use AI to provide personalized treatment recommendations based on the patient’s unique medical history, current condition, and evidence-based guidelines. The system should adapt recommendations as new data becomes available.
- [x] **Task 4:** Patient Engagement Tools: Develop features that engage patients in their own care, such as personalized health recommendations, educational content, and progress tracking tools.
- [x] **Task 5:** Patient Management Dashboard: Create a comprehensive dashboard that allows healthcare providers to view and manage patient data, diagnostic results, and treatment plans. Include visualization tools to help with decision-making and track patient progress over time.

## Key Features

- **Feature 1:** Chronic Disease Prediction Model -This AI model is trained on extensive patient data, including lifestyle factors, medical history, and genetic information. It can predict the likelihood of chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension.’
- **Feature 2:** General Disease Prediction Model- The model focuses on diagnosing a wide range of diseases based on symptoms. Using machine learning algorithms, it analyzes patient inputs such as symptoms to accurately diagnose conditions.
- **Feature 3:** Medicine Recommendation Model-:Once a diagnosis is made, this model provides personalized medicine recommendations tailored to the patient’s specific condition, medical history, and potential drug interactions. It leverages a vast database of pharmaceutical information and clinical guidelines to suggest the most effective and safe treatment options.
